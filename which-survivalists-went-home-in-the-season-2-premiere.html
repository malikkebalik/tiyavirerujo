In the July 14 season premiere, 14 survivalists arrived in Africa’s Munzwa Valley for a 45-day challenge.

Each player is tasked with crafting a primitive cutting tool to use to saw through a rope in order to claim a knife. They then must use the knife to fashion a primitive hook, which they need to obtain a map floating on a log in crocodile-infested waters. The map will direct them to their group campsite. The last man and woman to complete the challenge will be eliminated.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_29>“You either have the skills or you don’t,” Jeff Zausch says. “People are really going to have to come out of the gate hard, or they’re going home today.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_75>As soon as they hear the instructions, the survivalists run off to search for the right rock to complete the first phase of the challenge. As a flintknapper, Darrin Reaay has a natural advantage on the men’s side and is the first to complete phase one. The other men follow, until just Jeff Zausch and Bulent Gurcan remain. Both are strong competitors, so it’s a surprise to see them trailing this early in the game.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_31>Though Darrin finishes phase 1 first, Gary Golding is the first man to snag his map. He casually strolls to the tree to find the message directing him to his camp.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_64>The rest of the survivalists fight to get their map. It soon becomes clear that an early lead doesn’t necessarily translate into a strong finish, and vice versa. Though Jeff was one of the last to get his knife, he doesn’t let that fluster him. He takes his time crafting a hook, and it pays off. He gets his map on the first try.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_16>Meanwhile, the women are fighting just as hard as the men to complete the crucial challenge.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_37>Ky Furneaux is the first woman to claim her knife. She’s followed closely by Trish Bulinsky, who becomes the first woman to reel in her map. Ky is close behind her, and they’re both safe from elimination.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_42>Some of the other women struggle to cut the rope with their makeshift tools. Dani Beauchemin is the last person to get her knife. In the end, she and Lacey Jones are the only two women who’ve yet to claim their map.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-goes-home-in-the-first-episode-of-naked-and-afraid-last-one-standing-season-2>Who goes home in the first episode of ‘Naked and Afraid: Last One Standing’ Season 2?</h2><p id=par-12_30>The only men remaining by the water’s edge are Russell Sage and Bulent. An unflustered Bulent gets his map and sets off, leaving a frustrated Russel behind in last place.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_10>“I’m happy, almost,” Bulent says after he completes the challenge.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_17>Russell is disappointed by his loss. But he admits he made some mistakes in the first challenge.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_43>“I put everything I had into it,” Russell says. “I saw a stick I thought was going to work well.” However, he “let his heart get ahead of his head” and didn’t do a good job of crafting his tool, which cost him.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-16_51>Dani might have been the last person to make it to the water, but she manages to get her map before Lacey. Moments later, Lacey reels in her map. Could she pass Dani and avoid elimination? Unfortunately, no. Dani finishes first, and an exhausted Lacey is knocked out of the competition.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-17_19>“I literally gave it all, everything. I was really looking forward to showing off my skills,” Lacey says.</p><p id=par-18_24>Lacey admits she was too focused on speed during the challenge and picked the “wrong tool for the job.” The results? An “embarrassing” elimination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trish-and-Fernando-Naked-and-Afraid-Last-One-Standing-1.webp?strip=all&quality=80"><p id=par-19_9>The remaining 12 survivalists are split into four groups:</p><ul><li>Gary, Lindsey, and Dani&nbsp;</li><li>Trish, Fernando Calderon, and Dan Link&nbsp;</li><li>Ky, Darrin, and Bulent&nbsp;</li><li>Kate Wentworth, Patrick French, and Jeff&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=par-20_39>The next morning, they receive information about where to find five valuable hunting and survival tools, including multiple bows, fishing tools, and a pelt. But there’s a twist. They can’t share items with other teams after they find them.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-21_48>Dan, Trish, and Fernando work together to find one of the bow caches. Meanwhile, Jeff and Kate are facing off against Gary, Lindsey, and Dani for the second bow. Dani embraces the ruthless Last One Standing spirit and steals Jeff’s rope when he leaves it unattended. He’s stunned</p><p id=par-22_43>“I thought you were vegan. Aren’t you guys nice?” Jeff says. Minutes later, he tries to <a href=#>get his revenge</a>. After Gary, Lindsey, and Dani retrieve the bow, Jeff moves to snatch it. But Lindsey is holding it, so it’s not up for grabs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-23_50>Bulent and Ky find one of the fishing assets. A second fishing line and hooks is hidden in the pond, but they decide not to search for it, leaving it for another group. Could that be a mistake? As we’ve already seen, sabotage might be key to winning this competition.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-24_27>Jeff is disappointed not to get the bow, but he and Kate score an important win when they retrieve an animal hide hidden in an acacia tree.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-25_47>Only one survival item remains. After a lengthy search, Fernando finds the fishing line and hooks that Ky and Bulent left behind in the pond. He, Dan, and Trsh already have the bow and arrow, and this additional item gives them an edge over the other teams.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-26_48>The survivalists retreat to their camp and take cover as the weather changes. Everyone struggles to stay warm as the wind picks up, temperatures drop, and night descends.&nbsp; It’s a reminder that in this challenge, they’re facing off not just against each other but also against Mother Nature.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-27_17>Naked and Afraid: Last One Standing Season 2 airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Discovery Channel.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-28_16>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7orfEnWSappRirqe%2BwKKbZqSRqMFuu82eZKyskaOxqrrGZqquqqaew6K4yKyrrGWnmru1eceopJ5lo5qutLvNZmlmqKKauqqx0Z5loaydoXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhich-survivalists-went-home-in-the-season-2-premiere.html&text=Which%20Survivalists%20Went%20Home%20in%20the%20Season%202%20Premiere%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhich-survivalists-went-home-in-the-season-2-premiere.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhich-survivalists-went-home-in-the-season-2-premiere.html&title=Which%20Survivalists%20Went%20Home%20in%20the%20Season%202%20Premiere%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhich-survivalists-went-home-in-the-season-2-premiere.html&title=Which%20Survivalists%20Went%20Home%20in%20the%20Season%202%20Premiere%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhich-survivalists-went-home-in-the-season-2-premiere.html&title=Which%20Survivalists%20Went%20Home%20in%20the%20Season%202%20Premiere%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhich-survivalists-went-home-in-the-season-2-premiere.html&description=Which%20Survivalists%20Went%20Home%20in%20the%20Season%202%20Premiere%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./does-scotts-fertilizer-expire.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Scotts fertilizer expire?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./prince-harry-went-scuba-diving-in-hawaii-with-invictus-veteran-gabe-george.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Prince Harry went scuba diving in Hawaii with Invictus veteran Gabe George">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
