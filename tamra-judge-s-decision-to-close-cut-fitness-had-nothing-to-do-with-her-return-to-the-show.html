The couple even made a creative promotional video for the gym, pranking friends at a party because the video momentarily appeared to be a sex tape.</p><p id=par-3_29>And while keeping the gym operational during the last few years was a priority, Judge said it’s time to close the doors and move onto a new chapter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tamra-judge-says-closing-cut-fitness-had-nothing-to-do-with-her-return-to-rhoc>Tamra Judge says closing CUT Fitness had nothing to do with her return to ‘RHOC’</h2><p id=par-4_51>Judge and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Two T’s in a Pod</a> podcast co-host Teddi Mellencamp took listeners by surprise when Mellencamp spilled that Judge was closing CUT Fitness after nearly 10 years. “No wonder she’s going back,” Mellencamp said about Judge’s return to RHOC. “She has no money, she has to close her gym down.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Tamra-Judge-Cut-Fitness.jpg><p id=par-5_65>That’s when Judge clarified, “We decided to close our gym down way before I got asked back to the show. So that had nothing to do with anything that’s going on right now,” she said. Adding, “Listen, we almost made it to [10] years. I’m proud of what we did, what we built. And you know what, you’ll all find out, more things are coming.”</p><p id=par-6_8>Judge added “It’s 100% a loss. It’s hard.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rhoc-wondered-if-cut-fitness-was-going-out-of-business-in-2020>‘RHOC’ wondered if CUT Fitness was going out of business in 2020</h2><p id=par-7_55>RHOC fans wondered if CUT Fitness was going under in early May 2020 when Judge shared on social media she was selling weights from the gym. She posted, “If you’re looking for weights, barbells, steps, dumbells, we are clearing house at Cut Fitness. No deliveries or shipments. Must pick up. Give us a call.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_51>Fans immediately wondered if Judge planned to close her gym as the world was still locked down due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. “Not closing down,” she told inquiring fans. “Just restructuring of [the] business to a personal training studio. No more group classes. No longer need all this small equipment.”</p><p id=par-9_31>Judge later added, “Yes. We got rid of class that needed a lot of small weights , Mats , etc. just doing personal training & spartan training when we reopen.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tamra-returns-to-rhoc-after-appearing-on-rhugt-ex-wives-club>Tamra returns to ‘RHOC’ after appearing on ‘RHUGT Ex-Wives Club’</h2><p id=par-10_32>Judge is back filming RHOC, so perhaps viewers will see her having to close the business. She’s been off the show for a few seasons, after being fired following season 14.</p><p id=par-11_63>She admitted being cut loose from the series was humbling and recently thanked producer Andy Cohen for firing her. She admitted her return gave her a totally different and new perspective on the show. “I think being off for two years is probably the best thing you could have done to me,” she said. But laughed, “<a href=#>Even though I didn’t like it!</a>“</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_82>She said a break from the show was actually good for her. “Because I was on the show for 12 years,” she said. “When you are on that long, you become a professional ‘Housewife.’ And then once you’re off of it, you’re like, oh, ouch … I did that? You live your life and you go on living your normal life. And then you come back and you’re like, ‘I was kinda an a**hole.’ So you come back with a different perspective.”</p><p id=par-13_27>Then added, “Things are gonna be totally different,” Judge insisted about her return to RHOC. “The kids are older.” She then joked, ‘So&nbsp;<a href=#>thank you for firing me.”</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2FqbvCZquapaKWeqvBw6CcrGWUmrCqv8iopWabnKTApnnCrqtmnpmpu6a%2F0malqKyYnruoedGeq66qnmLAqbvWZ5%2BtpZxk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftamra-judge-s-decision-to-close-cut-fitness-had-nothing-to-do-with-her-return-to-the-show.html&text=Tamra%20Judge%27s%20Decision%20to%20Close%20CUT%20Fitness%20Had%20Nothing%20to%20Do%20With%20Her%20Return%20to%20the%20Show&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftamra-judge-s-decision-to-close-cut-fitness-had-nothing-to-do-with-her-return-to-the-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftamra-judge-s-decision-to-close-cut-fitness-had-nothing-to-do-with-her-return-to-the-show.html&title=Tamra%20Judge%27s%20Decision%20to%20Close%20CUT%20Fitness%20Had%20Nothing%20to%20Do%20With%20Her%20Return%20to%20the%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftamra-judge-s-decision-to-close-cut-fitness-had-nothing-to-do-with-her-return-to-the-show.html&title=Tamra%20Judge%27s%20Decision%20to%20Close%20CUT%20Fitness%20Had%20Nothing%20to%20Do%20With%20Her%20Return%20to%20the%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftamra-judge-s-decision-to-close-cut-fitness-had-nothing-to-do-with-her-return-to-the-show.html&title=Tamra%20Judge%27s%20Decision%20to%20Close%20CUT%20Fitness%20Had%20Nothing%20to%20Do%20With%20Her%20Return%20to%20the%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftamra-judge-s-decision-to-close-cut-fitness-had-nothing-to-do-with-her-return-to-the-show.html&description=Tamra%20Judge%27s%20Decision%20to%20Close%20CUT%20Fitness%20Had%20Nothing%20to%20Do%20With%20Her%20Return%20to%20the%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-was-there-no-funeral-for-the-beatles-star.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Was There No Funeral for the Beatles Star?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./randall-cobb-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Randall Cobb Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
