He retired on August 17, after missing almost half of the team's training camp with a knee injury.</p><p>He was released after starting the first 2 games of the 1992 season on September 14, to make room for <a href=#>Russell Maryland</a> upon his return from a toe injury. He started 41 out of 67 possible games and recorded 15 sacks in his Cowboys career.</p><p>On September 16, 1992, he was claimed off waivers by the Green Bay Packers, played 6 games as a backup in the team's 3-4 defense and recorded 4 tackles, before being waived on November 10.</p><p>In 1991, he was inducted into the Nebraska Football Hall of Fame. In 2005, he was selected by the Omaha World-Herald as one of Nebraska's Top 100 greatest athletes.</p><p>After starting the first 3 games at right tackle in 1991, with the addition of <a href=#>Tony Casillas</a>, plus the emergence of <a href=#>Russell Maryland</a> and <a href=#>Jimmie Jones</a>, he was moved to a backup role and played sparingly the rest of the season, making 20 tackles (2 for loss), one quarterback pressure, one pass defensed and one sack.</p><p>In 1990, he regained his starting role (15 starts), finishing fourth (first among defensive lineman) on the team in tackles (85), while also making 4.5 sacks, 16 quarterback pressures and 4 passes defensed.</p><p>In 1989, he missed 9 games with a groin injury he suffered in training camp, posting only 5 starts in 7 games, 23 tackles, 9 quarterback pressures, one sack and one pass defensed.</p><p>By his second season he was considered the Cowboys strongest player, being able to bench press 505 pounds. Despite suffering hip, knee and heel injuries, his best year statistically was in 1988, when he replaced White as the starter at right tackle, recording 16 starts, 84 tackles, 7.5 sacks (tied for the team lead with Garry Cobb) and returned one interception for a touchdown. Against the Atlanta Falcons, he intercepted a pass tipped at the line of scrimmage and returned it 17 yards for a touchdown and sacked quarterback <a href=#>Chris Miller</a> for a safety. In the eighth game against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had 9 tackles and 3 sacks.</p><p>Noonan was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round (12th overall) of the 1987 NFL Draft, with the intention of being the eventual successor to All-Pro <a href=#>Randy White</a> and to help revitalize an aging defensive line. After having the longest holdout by a rookie in franchise history at the time, he fell behind in learning the nuances of head coach Tom Landry's flex defense and was only a situational player. He began at defensive end, before being moved to defensive tackle in the second half of the season. White was limited with injuries, so Noonan helped in run situations, finishing with 27 tackles and one sack.</p><p>Noonan was born six miles from the University of Nebraska campus. He attended Lincoln Northeast High School, where he played both defensive and offensive tackle. As a senior in 1982, he helped the team win a state title, while receiving All-American and All-state honors. He was selected to play in the state’s 1983 All-Star Shrine Bowl football game played at Nebraska Memorial Stadium.</p><p>Daniel Nicholas Noonan (born July 14, 1965) is a former American football defensive end in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers. He played college football at the University of Nebraska.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfma6vuthmpainnpa7bq3Mnqmim5Gjeqe7zq2ZmqSc</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdanny-noonan-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&text=Danny%20Noonan%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdanny-noonan-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdanny-noonan-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Danny%20Noonan%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdanny-noonan-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Danny%20Noonan%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdanny-noonan-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Danny%20Noonan%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdanny-noonan-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&description=Danny%20Noonan%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./duchess-kate-hired-a-real-stylist-while-natasha-archer-is-on-maternity-leave.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Duchess Kate hired a real stylist while Natasha Archer is on maternity leave">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./we-wanted-to-approach-that-with-such-a-sensitivity-kelsey-asbille-discusses-that-heartbreakin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="We wanted to approach that with such a sensitivity: Kelsey Asbille discusses that heartbreakin">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
