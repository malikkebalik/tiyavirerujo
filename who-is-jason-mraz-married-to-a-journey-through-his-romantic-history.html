There, he was open and honest about his coming to terms with his bis*xuality and the experiences he has had since coming out.</p><p><strong>You can also find out who are these famous celebrities married to:</strong></p><h2>How Many Times has Jason Mraz Got Marry?</h2><p>The Hollywood rumour mill has it that Jason Mraz and Sheridan Edley got married in 2001 and split up the following year. The singer-songwriter best known for his hit “Waiting for My Rocket to Come” reportedly became engaged to another musician and longtime friend in 2010; however, the couple split after only six months.</p><p><strong>In a small, intimate ceremony held in his hometown of Mechanicsville, Virginia, Mraz wed his longtime love Christina Carano in October 2015.</strong></p><p>In June of this year, during a party honouring the success of his 2023 studio album Mystical Magical Rhythmical Radical Ride at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, he made the announcement that he and Carano were divorcing. Reportedly still married to Carano in 2018, the singer came out that year.</p><h2>How Did Jason Mraz’s Journey to Accept His S*xuality Impact His Marriage?</h2><p>Dancing with the Stars competitor Jason Mraz, 46, recently spoke up to GLAAD about being bisexual and coming out. Mraz is competing this season with dance partner Daniella Karagach. He went into detail about how his journey to accept his s*xuality had cost him his marriage. Mraz continued, describing how he had experienced “shame” and “guilt” in the past but had overcome those emotions to get to where he is now.</p><p>He continued by saying it was “nice to be acknowledged” and being on this year’s Out100 list, calling it “as hot as the Billboard 100!” The list recognizes those who have made significant contributions to the LGBTQ+ movement.</p><p>Mraz further elaborated on how his participation in this year’s Dancing with the Stars, now in its 32nd season, has been both a pleasant surprise and an emotionally revealing experience that has helped him accept his bisexuality. He continued by saying that it was challenging to accept what he saw when he first looked in the mirror.</p><p>Earlier this year, Mraz gave an interview to The Advocate in which he shared similar thoughts on being a homos*xual musician. As he put it back then, he spent the first twenty years of his profession “broadcasting as hetero” due to his upbringing in a conservative environment full of homoph*bia. He had also remarked how he felt like he “needed to protect some secret.”</p><p>This Love Is an Alluding to a Code in Four Word artist also gave credit to his second wife, claiming she was essential in his coming to terms with his s*xuality. In addition, he admitted to having “curiosities and experiences on the side,” all of which contributed to his eventual identity reveal as someone “honest,” “loving,” and “inclusive.”</p><h2>How Does Jason Mraz Balance His Music Career with His Dancing Endeavors?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jason-Mraz-Career.jpg><p>Mraz is committed to a healthy diet and lifestyle, and has spoken publicly about his preference for raw vegan fare.
