Note that this sum represents her combined net worth with her celebrity chef husband <a href=# title="Gabriele Corcos Net Worth">Gabriele Corcos</a>. Fans may recognize her from her early roles in movies like "Goodfellas," "Little Man Tate," and "Singles" during the 90s. However, she later became better known for her TV work, appearing in shows like "Civil Wars," "L.A. Law," and "Entourage." The latter role earned Mazar significant notoriety. She is also known for her starring role in "Younger," which is TV Land's longest-running original series. Outside of acting, Debi has collaborated with her husband on a few notable cooking shows, like "Extra Virgin."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Deborah Anne Mazar was born on August 13th of 1964 in New York City. Raised in the Queens neighborhood of Jamaica, Debi grew up in a family with Jewish roots, although she practiced Catholocism at an early age. Unfortunately, Mazar's parents split up shortly after she was born, and she was raised primarily by her mother. She also spent large portions of her childhood living in upstate New York.</p><p>During her teen years, she relocated to Long Island and lived with her godparents. During these early years, Mazar worked as a jewelry salesperson with Italian fashion label Fiorucci, rubbing shoulders with figures like Linda Ramone, and Joey Arias. She also spent time working as a dental assistant and a nightclub worker.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Mazar's entertainment career began when she ran into <a href=# title="Madonna Net Worth">Madonna</a> while working at a nightclub. Debi was hired by the singer to do her makeup, and she spent the next period working as a makeup artist for music videos and plays. Mazar then had a stint working as a b-girl in New York City, working with various hip hop dance shows such as "Graffiti Rock" during the 80s. Continuing her association with Madonna, Debi can be spotted in music videos for tracks like "Papa Don't Preach" and "Music."</p><p>During the 90s, Debi started to book supporting roles in various movies, starting with 1990's "Goodfellas." In what many consider to be the best mob movie of all time, Mazar plays the lead character's coke-addicted mistress. The film proved to be a massive commercial and critical hit. She booked similar supporting roles in movies like "The Doors," "<a href=# title="Malcolm X Net Worth">Malcolm X</a>," and "Bullets Over Broadway" throughout the early 90s. Another major role came with 1995's "Batman Forever," in which she played one of Two-Face's assistants called "Spice."</p><p>Although these film roles were helping Mazar become a recognizable figure in Hollywood, some argue that she didn't truly break through until she began booking major TV roles. The first of these came in the early 90s, during which she booked a character in the legal drama "Civil Wars." When this series came to an end, her character appeared in "L.A. Law" During the early 90s. During the early 90s, Mazar also played the villain Regina in "Beethoven's Second."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-164936 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Debi-Mazar-pic.jpg alt="Debi Mazar" width=396 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-164936 class=wp-caption-text>Ben Gabbe/Getty Images</p><p>Fans of the sitcom "Friends" may also recognize her for an appearance in the series' eighth season.

She later reprised this role in "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas."</p><p>In 2004, Mazar returned to the world of television in style with a supporting role in the series "Entourage." Mazar played press agent Shauna Roberts in the series. She also booked a recurring role in the sitcom "Living with Fran" during this period and appeared in a few episodes of "Ugly Betty."
