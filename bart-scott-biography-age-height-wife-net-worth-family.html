In January 2020, alongside <a href=#>Alan Hahn</a>, Scott launched a local show for ESPN New York in the mid-day slot previously occupied by <a href=#>Stephen A. Smith</a>.</p><p>In February 2014, it was announced that Scott would join CBS' The NFL Today for the 2014 season. In 2017, it was announced that Scott was replaced by <a href=#>Nate Burleson</a>.</p><p>He was employed as an NFL analyst for CBS television from 2013 to 2017. Scott is currently employed as the co-host of a sports talk radio show on ESPN Radio in New York City.</p><p>Scott's final two years with the Jets were marred by struggles and controversy on and off the field. On January 1, 2012, the day after the Jets missed the playoffs after losing their last 3 games, Scott was fined $10,000 for showing an obscene gesture in front of a cameraman while in the locker room. That September, Scott threatened to assault a photographer in the Jets' locker room. In November, Scott tried and failed to organize a media boycott; however, it lasted only a few moments. Later that month, Scott verbally attacked fans after the Jets gave up 35 second quarter points in a 49-19 blowout loss to New England. The Jets failed to make the playoffs in Scott's final two seasons with the team putting up a combined record of 14–18. According to Pro Football Focus, Scott ranked last among inside linebackers in tackling efficiency in 2012.</p><p>After the Jets defeated the New England Patriots in an AFC Divisional Playoff game on January 16, 2011, ESPN's <a href=#>Sal Paolantonio</a> approached Scott for an interview. Scott interrupted Paolantonio with a rant supporting his team and antagonizing "non-believers." A clip of the interview went viral after being posted on YouTube. Despite Scott's boasting, the Jets lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship the following week. On March 3, 2011, Scott made an appearance for professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on their TNA Impact! television show, appearing alongside Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair at a wedding ceremony between Jeff Jarrett and <a href=#>Karen Jarrett</a> and in the end tapping out to Kurt Angle's ankle lock.</p><p>In 2009, Scott became a free agent. Both the Ravens and New York Jets vied for Scott's services. After the Jets amended their contract offer by adding a year to the deal, Scott signed the six-year, $48 million contract with New York on February 27, 2009. This would reunite him with head coach Rex Ryan, his former defensive coach in Baltimore, whom Scott has stated he would follow anywhere.</p><p>Scott started all 16 games for the second straight season and recorded 131 tackles, one sack and three passes defended. On December 3, 2007, Scott was penalized twice for unsportsmanlike conduct in the fourth quarter of the Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots. The second call came after Scott picked up the official's flag from the first call and threw it. Following the game, teammate <a href=#>Samari Rolle</a> made accusations of disrespectful language by the official involved. In his final year with Baltimore, Scott again started all 16 games contributing with 104 tackles, 1.5 sacks and five passes defended.</p><p>Scott has been very involved with the community; he is involved in multiple charities, including A Son Never Forgets, a foundation dedicated to helping those suffering with paralysis which was established by Scott himself in October 2006. Scott has also dedicated money to his former neighborhood, buying a plot of land to build a playground near his grandmother's home in addition to providing equipment and speaking with students at his alma mater, Southeastern High School.</p><p>Scott continues to return to Southeastern High School nearly every year to speak with students. Additionally, Scott paid for new uniforms and equipment in 2005 and provided money to upgrade the weight room in 2007. Scott also paid to have a new set of bleachers installed at the school after vandals stole the school's former bleachers. In honor of Scott's accomplishments on and off the field, Southeastern retired his jersey in 2008.</p><p>Scott later returned to Southern Illinois in 2005 to finish his academic studies, graduating with a degree in economics. Scott later became a first-ballot member of the Southern Illinois' Hall of Fame.</p><p>Scott saw significant playing time during the 2005 season as <a href=#>Ray Lewis</a> suffered a hamstring injury, playing in all 16 games and making 10 starts. He finished the season with 119 tackles, four sacks, two forced fumbles, one fumble recovery and four passes defended. Scott signed a three-year, $13.5 million contract extension with the Ravens, turning down an offer from the Cleveland Browns. In 2006, Scott ended the season with a career-high 135 tackles, 9.5 sacks, two interceptions and nine passes defended. He played in the Pro Bowl in Hawaii as an alternate after being elected to replace his teammate <a href=#>Ray Lewis</a>. Scott was named to the Associated Press' second All-Pro team.</p><p>Kill touted Scott's abilities to several NFL teams but only the Baltimore Ravens sent out a scout to assess Scott. The scout was impressed by Scott and three days following the 2002 NFL Draft, after going undrafted, Scott signed a contract with the Ravens.</p><p>During Scott's first three years with Baltimore, he was a special teams standout. However, he saw little time in the defensive rotation. In his rookie season, he played in all 16 regular season games and recorded five tackles and one interception on defense while tying with another teammate to lead the team in special teams tackles at 17. He made his NFL debut at the Carolina Panthers on September 8, 2002. The following season, he again played in all 16 games and one post-season game, recording nine tackles and one fumble recovery on defense. His 19 special teams tackles, a career high, ranked second on the team. In the 2004 season, he played in 13 games, making 17 special teams tackles, adding five tackles on defense playing as a safety and linebacker.</p><p>Bartholomew <a href=#>Edward Scott</a> (born August 18, 1980) is a former American football player and current radio personality. Scott was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for eleven seasons. After playing college football for Southern Illinois University, he was signed by the NFL's Baltimore Ravens as an undrafted free agent in 2002. Scott was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2006. After playing his first seven years with Ravens, Scott signed with New York Jets in 2009. He would play his final four seasons for the Jets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfl66zwIysmqispA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbart-scott-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&text=Bart%20Scott%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbart-scott-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbart-scott-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Bart%20Scott%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbart-scott-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Bart%20Scott%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbart-scott-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Bart%20Scott%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbart-scott-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&description=Bart%20Scott%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./debi-mazar-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Debi Mazar Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./aguek-arop-bio-age-height-parents-girlfriend-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aguek Arop Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Girlfriend, Wiki">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
