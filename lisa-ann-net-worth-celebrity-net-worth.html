Lisa Ann is most famous for her work as an adult film actress, and the most notable of her adult videos involved her starring as "Serra Paylin," a parody of the real-life politician <a href=#>Sarah Palin</a>. Many consider her to be the most well-known adult actress in the world. She retired in 2014 but returned to the adult film industry in 2018.</p><p>Outside of adult films, she has appeared in a range of mainstream media productions. She has appeared on "The <a href=# title="Howard Stern Net Worth">Howard Stern</a> Show" and worked as a voice actor on video games such as "Grand Theft Auto V." She has also starred in various music videos and television series.</p><h2 id=early-life-adult-film-career><strong>Early Life and Adult Film Career</strong></h2><p>Lisa Ann Corpora was born on May 9th of 1972 in Easton, Pennsylvania. She was raised in the small city of Easton and became an avid athlete during her high school years. While in school, Lisa joined the basketball team and the ski club. She later stated that if she hadn't gone into the adult film industry, she probably would have pursued a career as a journalist or blogger.</p><h2 id=first-experiences-with-adult-film><strong>First Experiences with the Adult Film Industry</strong></h2><p>Lisa Ann entered the adult film industry at the age of 22 in 1994. She started slow, filming just once a month with the company Metro/Cal Vista. Three years into her career, she quit because of an AIDS pandemic that was running riot within the adult world.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-237641 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-Ann.jpg alt="Lisa Ann Net Worth" width=457 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-237641 class=wp-caption-text>Ethan Miller/Getty Images</p><h2 id=stripping><strong>Stripping</strong></h2><p>For the next seven years, Lisa Ann worked as a stripper. With her money from stripping, Ann was able to open her own day spa, which she ran for four years.</p><h2 id=return-adult-videos><strong>Return to Adult Videos</strong></h2><p>In 2006, Lisa was convinced to return to the adult industry, posing for a boy/girl shoot with photographer Suze Randall. She then transitioned into adult videos. Two years later, Lisa impersonated Sarah Palin for the first time in the video "Who's Nailin' Paylin?" The video was released on election day and generated all kinds of media buzz. Lisa Ann took her role seriously and watched the vice-presidential debates to study the body language and demeanor of Sarah Palin. She also referred to performances by <a href=# title="Tina Fey Net Worth">Tina Fey</a>, who had also impersonated the former Governor of Alaska on "Saturday Night Live."</p><p>Due to the success of "Who's Nailin' Paylin," sequels soon followed. These included "Obama is Nailin' Paylin," "Letterman's Nailin' Paylin," "You're Nailin' Paylin," "Hollywood's Nailin' Paylin," and "Who's Nailin' Paylin? 2." In addition, Lisa Ann played the role of Sarah Palin in a music video by <a href=# title="Eminem Net Worth">Eminem</a> and performed the role while stripping on stage.</p><p>Throughout the next few years, she became a major figure in the adult industry, and she hosted the XRCO Awards in 2010. By 2014, she was ready to retire, and she announced that she was leaving the industry in a Facebook post. That being said, she continued to appear in live webcam videos over the next few days.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-305193 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Lisa-Ann.jpg alt width=900 height=601 sizes="(max-width: 1900px) 100vw, 1900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-305193 class=wp-caption-text>BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/GettyImages</p><h2 id=second-return-adult-videos><strong>Second Return to Adult Videos</strong></h2><p>In 2018, Lisa Ann returned to the adult industry for a second time. She signed with Evil Angel and quickly filmed four more scenes. During this period, she also established her own website.</p><h2 id=mainstream-media><strong>Mainstream Media</strong></h2><p>Lisa Ann appeared on "The Howard Stern Show" prior to entering the adult film industry. In 2008, she appeared on "Entertainment Tonight" on the heels of her success in the adult industry after impersonating Sarah Palin. She also voiced the character "Prostitute #2" in the Rockstar video game "Grand Theft Auto V." Additionally, Ann appeared on the show "Billions" and on radio shows connected to Barstool Sports.</p><h2 id=behind-scenes><strong>Behind the Scenes</strong></h2><p>In addition to performing in front of the camera during adult film shoots, Lisa Ann has become quite involved in the production process. She is no stranger to directing her own adult films, having first started in 2009 with "Hung XXX." In 2013, she established her own production company called Lisa Ann Productions. After signing a distribution deal with <a href=# title="Jules Jordan Net Worth">Jules Jordan</a> Video, she directed "MILF Revolution" under the banner of her new production company.</p><p>Lisa Ann also experienced considerable success as a talent agent within the adult industry. In 2005, she started working for LA Direct Models but quickly discovered that there was an unexploited niche for women over 30. These so-called "MILF" performers often struggled to find representation, and so she created Clear Talent Management in order to cater to these women. The agency closed down in 2010.</p><h2 id=activism><strong>Activism</strong></h2><p>Lisa Ann was one of the earliest figures within the adult film industry to call for the reform of STD-testing procedures. After returning to the industry following the AIDS scare in the 90s, Ann insisted on having her male co-stars wear condoms while performing scenes. She also encouraged other female performers to do the same and even went so far as to call for legislation mandating the use of condoms in adult scenes.</p><p>In addition, she questioned the efficacy of specific STD tests within the industry, such as syphilis tests. She was very active in doing her own investigative work to discover whether adequate testing had been carried out, and in 2013 she claimed that one of her potential co-stars tried to perform with her despite being tested positive for hepatitis C. In response, the Adult Production Health & Safety Service started to conduct more stringent, standardized testing within the industry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7zKibnqSjZLmqv8BmmKemXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flisa-ann-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Lisa%20Ann%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flisa-ann-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flisa-ann-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Lisa%20Ann%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flisa-ann-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Lisa%20Ann%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flisa-ann-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Lisa%20Ann%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flisa-ann-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Lisa%20Ann%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./david-price-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Price Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dusty-hill-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dusty Hill Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
