At the age of 16, Avril Lavign signed a $2 million, 2-album recording contract with Arista Records. A year later she became a superstar with the&nbsp; debut album "Let Go." To date Avril has sold more than 30 million albums and over 50 million singles worldwide, making her the youngest female soloist to reach No. 1 in the UK. Lavigne has also appeared in several movies, including "Going the Distance" (2004), "Fast Food Nation" (2006), and animated features "Over the Hedge" (2006) and "Charming" (2018).</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Avril Lavigne was born Avril Ramona Lavigne on September 27, 1984, in Belleville, Ontario, Canada. She grew up with mother Judith-Rosanne, father Jean-Claude, older brother Matthew, and younger sister Michelle. The family moved to the small town of Greater Napanee, Ontario, when Avril was 5, and her father converted their home's basement into a music studio and bought Avril a microphone, keyboard, and drum kit as well as a few guitars. Lavigne soon began performing <a href=# title="Garth Brooks Net Worth">Garth Brooks</a> and <a href=# title="Shania Twain Net Worth">Shania Twain</a> covers at country fairs and writing her own songs.

He sent videotapes of Avril's home performances to his industry contacts, and Mark Jowett of the Canadian management firm Nettwerk arranged for Lavigne to go to New York to work with producer/songwriter Peter Zizzo in the summer of 2000. In November of that year, A&R representative Ken Krongard invited the head of Arista Records, Antonio "L.A." Reid, to hear Avril sing at Zizzo's studio, and he signed her to a $1.25 million record deal and offered her a $900,000 publishing advance.</p><p>Lavigne finished recording her first album, "Let Go," in January 2002, and it hit #2 on the "Billboard" 200 chart when it was released in June. The album reached #1 in Canada, Australia, and the U.K., and it was certified 4-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) by the end of the year (and 7-times platinum by 2018). Avril was 2002's bestselling female artist, and "Let Go" sold more copies than any other debut album that year. Her first single, "Complicated," reached # 1 in Australia and #2 in the U.S., and singles "I'm with You" and "Sk8er Boi" were top 10 hits, making Lavigne only the second artist with 3 top 10 hits from a debut album on the "Billboard" Mainstream Top 40 chart. Avril was featured on the cover of "Rolling Stone" magazine in March 2003.</p><p>Lavigne followed "Let Go" with "Under My Skin" (2004), "The Best Damn Thing" (2007), "Goodbye Lullaby" (2011), "Avril Lavigne" (2013), and "Head Above Water" (2019) and released several hit singles, including "My Happy Ending" and "Girlfriend.
