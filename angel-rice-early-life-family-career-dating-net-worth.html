From nothing to everything, Rice has won the hearts of many people. So, let’s get started right now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/angel-0002-1.jpg><p>Here are some exciting facts about the young cheerleader.</p><h2>Angel Rice: Quick Facts</h2><table class=facts><tbody><tr><th>Full Name:</th><td>Angel Rice</td></tr><tr><th>Age:</th><td>21 years</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Date:</th><td>December 4, 1998</td></tr><tr><th>Horoscope:</th><td>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place:</th><td>Atlanta, Georgia, USA</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity:</th><td>African-American</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality:</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status:</th><td>Unmarried</td></tr><tr><th>Profession:</th><td>Cheerleader, Gymnast</td></tr><tr><th>Team:</th><td>USA Gymnastics National Power Tumbling Team</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth:</th><td>Under Review</td></tr><tr><th>Social Media:</th><td><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Age and Height: How Tall Is Angel Rice?</h2><p>As of 2019, this young budding talent is 21 years.

Not to mention, she has dark brown eyes and long silky black hair, which complements her caramel skin.</p><p>However, any other information like her height and weight are unknown as of now. We will make sure to update you about this soon.</p><h2>Early Life, Education, and Family</h2><p>The world champion Angel Rice was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the United States of America. Her loving parents raised her along with her siblings, an older sister named<strong> De’kiera Rice,</strong> and a brother named <strong>Jaden Rice</strong>.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenny Watwood Bio- Dating, Age, Height, Family, Net Worth, Career >></a></h4><p>Unfortunately, we have no information regarding her parents. Hence their names and whereabouts are still in the dark. As for her education, the young Rice graduated from high school. Aside from these, no additional information has been given regarding her academics.</p><h2>Professional Career: Who Is Angel Rice? What Does She Do?</h2><p>Angel’s career is somewhat a movie plot, from nothing to everything. From an early age, the young Rice had an interest in gymnastics. However, due to some financial difficulties, she was not able to join a formal gymnastics class.</p><p>But still, Rice did not give up. Instead, she trained with her mother, who had learned titbits by watching her older sister during her tumbling lessons. Since they had financial problems, her parents enrolled only her sister in the class.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/angel-0003.jpg><p>From then on, Rice continued working hard. She rose to prominence only in 2015 when she set the world record for on the category of ‘the full double twists inside a minute.’ Likewise, Rice performed on the day time American TV Show ‘TODAY plaza’ on August 31, 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, her life as a gymnast has also taken an uphill. As of now, the young Angel has participated in over three international games representing the United States. Similarly, in 2017, at a match held in Calgary, Canada, Rice won a silver medal for tumbling.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fala Chen Bio- Husband, Married, Net Worth, Age, Height, Movies >></a></h4><p>Moreover, Rice has also won World Cheerleading Championship three times; on Stingrays Orange Small Senior 5 in 2012, on California Allstars Smoked Small Senior Co-ed in 2015, and in 2019 World Cheerleading Champion.&nbsp;</p><h2>Angel Rice: Personal Life- Is She Dating Anyone? Is She Single?</h2><p>Since Angel is a national player and the World Champion, her life is always under the radar of media and the limelight. There is no stopping when people, as well as her fans, want to know more about her.</p><p>Likewise, it seems the young National player is secretly dating someone. Though she has not mentioned much about it, she is seen flirting with a boy named <strong>Johnny Kilroy.</strong> Rice even posted a picture with this unknown man.</p><p>However, the star herself has neither claimed nor denied the rumors regarding her dating life. Until then, we can not clearly say it ourselves.</p><h2>Net Worth and Income</h2><p>Gone are the days when Rice had to train with her mother due to financial difficulties. As of now, this young budding star has been earning enough from her profession as a national gymnast.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gio Grace Levine Age, Height, Parents, Name Meaning, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>However, as of 2019, Rice’s net worth is still under review and has yet to be disclosed. But we believe it to be around the millions. Moreover, she makes an additional income from other projects like advertisements and campaigns for the leading global brands like ‘FLAT TUMMY CO.’&nbsp;</p><p>From the promotion alone, the gymnast makes around<strong> $2,006.25</strong> per post from the companies. Furthermore, Rice is also the CEO of the Queens Hair Collection, an online shop for wigs.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>–&nbsp; 395k Followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>–&nbsp; 18.6k Followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57wKeenqRdp7aksYyanp5lmJq2qLTTZp2apZmhxm6vwKucnqpdma61tc2gZKedpGLEsL7ToWSipqOprqi%2BwKZm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fangel-rice-early-life-family-career-dating-net-worth.html&text=Angel%20Rice%3a%20Early%20Life%2c%20Family%2c%20Career%2c%20Dating%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fangel-rice-early-life-family-career-dating-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fangel-rice-early-life-family-career-dating-net-worth.html&title=Angel%20Rice%3a%20Early%20Life%2c%20Family%2c%20Career%2c%20Dating%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fangel-rice-early-life-family-career-dating-net-worth.html&title=Angel%20Rice%3a%20Early%20Life%2c%20Family%2c%20Career%2c%20Dating%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fangel-rice-early-life-family-career-dating-net-worth.html&title=Angel%20Rice%3a%20Early%20Life%2c%20Family%2c%20Career%2c%20Dating%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fangel-rice-early-life-family-career-dating-net-worth.html&description=Angel%20Rice%3a%20Early%20Life%2c%20Family%2c%20Career%2c%20Dating%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bif-naked-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bif Naked Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./a-tennessee-judge-finally-removed-michael-oher-s-19-year-long-conservatorship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Tennessee judge finally removed Michael Ohers 19-year-long conservatorship">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
