However, it wasn’t until recently when he freestyled in the now-viral YouTube video and appeared on an episode of Saturday Night Live&nbsp;that people really started to see him as a talented rapper.</p><p id=par-2_24>While many know that DaBaby has exceptional skills when it comes to rapping, there isn’t much else that fans know about this talented artist.</p><p id=par-3_37>So, what is DaBaby’s real name and where is he from? Keep reading to find out everything that you need to know about this talented artist’s history and his successful career that he has had so far.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where is DaBaby from and what is his real name?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DaBaby-3.jpg><p id=par-4_42>DaBaby’s real name is Jonathan Lyndale Kirk and he was born in Cleveland, Ohio. However, when he was around 7 years old, he moved to Charlotte, North Carolina with his family and continued to live there for the remainder of his childhood.</p><p id=par-5_49>DaBaby has had a couple of different names throughout the years. In 2005, he had started to seriously pursue a career in music. He had made a few mixtapes and a couple of singles under the name “Baby Jesus.” He didn’t use that stage name for long, though.</p><p id=par-6_38>After he released his first mixtape, he decided to change his stage name to DaBaby because he was afraid that the other name was too politically controversial and that it didn’t fit in with the hip hop industry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does DaBaby have a criminal record?</h2><p id=par-7_47>While DaBaby has an obvious love for rapping, it seems like he is equally talented in the art of fighting as well. No matter how much this up-and-coming rap star tries to avoid getting in fights, it seems like trouble continues to follow him wherever he goes.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_35>Recently, he was involved in a fight with another North Carolina-based paper named&nbsp;Cam Coldheart at his local mall. The rapper had continued to taunt DaBaby while he was shopping at a Louis Vuitton store.</p><p id=par-9_50>Eventually, the taunting led to both men getting very angry and soon there was a full-blown fight between the two men right in the middle of the store. The two rappers had been feuding for a while but nobody thought that their feud would have escalated to this level.</p><p id=par-10_20>DaBaby&nbsp;<a href=#>posted footage of the fight online</a> in an attempt to show other rappers what happens when you mess with him<a href=#>.</a></p><p id=par-11_52>That s not the first time that DaBaby has been in trouble for fighting. A few years ago, he and another man named Jalyn Domonique Craig got into a fight at a Walmart in Huntersville, North Carolina. The fight escalated into a shootout, which caused 19-year-old Craig to lose his life.</p><p id=par-12_35>DaBaby had said he had acted self-defense and the murder charge that he was facing was eventually dropped. However, he was found guilty of carrying a firearm and was sentenced to&nbsp;<a href=#>one year of unsupervised probation.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>DaBaby’s musical achievements</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-13_39>In 2015, DaBaby (known as Baby Jesus back then) came out with a mixtape entitled,&nbsp;Nonfiction,&nbsp;that didn’t do that well. However, he had released four more mixtapes over the next few years and each mixtape continued to gain popularity.</p><p id=par-14_24>Then, in 2019, he went on a radio show where he laid down<a href=#>&nbsp;one of the smoothest freestyle sessions</a>&nbsp;that the radio listeners had ever heard.</p><p id=par-15_52>This year, he also signed a contract with Interscope Records and South Coast Music Group and has debuted his first album, entitled&nbsp;Baby On Baby.&nbsp;In September of this year, he had released his second album, entitled Kirk, and the album had quickly made it to the top of the Billboard Top 200 charts.</p><p id=par-16_32>DaBaby’s career is just getting started. And the way fans are already going crazy for this unique and talented rapper, it doesn’t look like his career will be slowing down anytime soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqbHRnmSiq12ZrqOtwbJkn6qfonqiusNmrqGZpGK2tHnHoqpmqpWWuW66wKacZ6Ckorlw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhere-is-dababy-from-and-what-is-his-real-name.html&text=Where%20is%20DaBaby%20From%20and%20What%20is%20His%20Real%20Name%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-is-dababy-from-and-what-is-his-real-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-is-dababy-from-and-what-is-his-real-name.html&title=Where%20is%20DaBaby%20From%20and%20What%20is%20His%20Real%20Name%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhere-is-dababy-from-and-what-is-his-real-name.html&title=Where%20is%20DaBaby%20From%20and%20What%20is%20His%20Real%20Name%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-is-dababy-from-and-what-is-his-real-name.html&title=Where%20is%20DaBaby%20From%20and%20What%20is%20His%20Real%20Name%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-is-dababy-from-and-what-is-his-real-name.html&description=Where%20is%20DaBaby%20From%20and%20What%20is%20His%20Real%20Name%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./did-gabriella-win-miss-connecticut-usa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Gabriella Win Miss Connecticut USA?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./watch-r-b-artist-maeta-bit-on-the-face-by-a-snake-during-video-shoot.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch: R&amp;amp;B artist Maeta bit on the face by a snake during video shoot">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
