The sisters began their stint on the series at a very young age and spent a large portion of their childhood on its set.

They both appeared on Full House and alternated playing the role of Michelle Tanner.</p><p id=par-3_16>Interestingly, Mary-Kate and Ashley were <a href=#>almost replaced</a> in the beginning because they apparently cried too much.</p><p id=par-4_61>Their co-star John Stamos once said in 2015, according to <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>, “It was very difficult to get the shot. So I [said], ‘Get them out!’ That is actually 100 percent accurate. They brought in a couple of unattractive redheaded kids. We tried that for a while and that didn’t work. [Producers] were like, all right, get the Olsen twins back.”</p><p id=par-5_41>Mary-Kate and Ashley continued to take turns playing Michelle, though in some instances, they got to appear on-screen together. For example, on the episode “Greek Week” in season 4, one twin played Michelle while the other played her identical cousin Melina.</p><p id=par-6_24>On the final episode, “Michelle Rides Again,” one twin also appeared on the show as Michelle’s memory after the character suffered a head injury.</p><p id=par-7_13>In total, Mary-Kate and Ashley were on Full House for about eight years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ashley-olsen-s-weirdest-memory-on-the-show-involves-a-shower>Ashley Olsen’s weirdest memory on the show involves a shower</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_22>The sisters have a number of memories from their time on Full House, and for Ashley, one such memory involves a shower.</p><p id=par-9_41>In an interview with <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a> in 2010, Ashley revealed that she and her sister “remember small things” from their experiences, such as “being in a shower with Dave,” referring to co-star Dave Coulier, who played Joey Gladstone on the show.</p><p id=par-10_15>Ashley also talked more about the shower memory a few years earlier with <a href=#>Rove Australia</a>.</p><p id=par-11_39>“If I see an episode, I definitely remember being in a shower, screaming because I’m so scared with the water,” she shared. “And someone’s dressed in a duck outfit with goggles. I kind of remember those sorts of things.”</p><p id=par-12_30>It’s not clear what these memories are referring to, but there are definitely a lot of interesting behind-the-scenes stories from Full House the cast and crew have yet to share.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-olsen-twins-are-focused-on-being-businesspeople-now>The Olsen twins are focused on being businesspeople now</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-13_21>Full House returned to the small screen in 2016 as <a href=#>Fuller House</a>, though Mary-Kate and Ashley did not join the reunion.</p><p id=par-14_28>In 2017, Mary-Kate explained to <a href=#>Cinema Blend</a>, “Ashley said, ‘I have not been in front of a camera since I was 17, and I don’t feel comfortable acting.”</p><p id=par-15_37>Since the mid-2000s, the sisters have moved away from the limelight to work behind-the-scenes in fashion. They launched their brands The Row and Elizabeth and James, both of which have been well-received by buyers and industry experts.</p><p id=par-16_17>Even when they were younger, it seems Mary-Kate and Ashley always considered themselves businesspeople more than actors.</p><p id=par-17_50>“With what we were doing in business when we were younger, I don’t think it ever felt like we were actresses,” Mary-Kay told Women’s Wear Daily in 2014, according to <a href=#>In Touch</a>. “Because we spend so much more of our time not in front of the cameras, building a brand.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSutLTLnrBmp5yosq%2B%2FjLCcoqqUmsC1ecWuo6VlmKTCtLGMppymp6Kueqq61aijr52jYq%2Bmtc2gZKKmXZZ6tLTOsJyrZpipuq17</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fashley-olsen-s-weirdest-full-house-memory-involves-being-in-a-shower.html&text=Ashley%20Olsens%20Weirdest%20%27Full%20House%27%20Memory%20Involves%20Being%20in%20a%20Shower&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fashley-olsen-s-weirdest-full-house-memory-involves-being-in-a-shower.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fashley-olsen-s-weirdest-full-house-memory-involves-being-in-a-shower.html&title=Ashley%20Olsens%20Weirdest%20%27Full%20House%27%20Memory%20Involves%20Being%20in%20a%20Shower" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fashley-olsen-s-weirdest-full-house-memory-involves-being-in-a-shower.html&title=Ashley%20Olsens%20Weirdest%20%27Full%20House%27%20Memory%20Involves%20Being%20in%20a%20Shower" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fashley-olsen-s-weirdest-full-house-memory-involves-being-in-a-shower.html&title=Ashley%20Olsens%20Weirdest%20%27Full%20House%27%20Memory%20Involves%20Being%20in%20a%20Shower" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fashley-olsen-s-weirdest-full-house-memory-involves-being-in-a-shower.html&description=Ashley%20Olsens%20Weirdest%20%27Full%20House%27%20Memory%20Involves%20Being%20in%20a%20Shower" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./barbara-walters-daughter-jackie-relationship-before-her-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Barbara Walters, Daughter Jackie Relationship Before Her Death">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-bob-benson-on-mad-men-it-s-not-great-without-pete-s-former-nemesis.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Bob Benson On 'Mad Men'?
