footballer (soccer player) is estimated to be a staggering $120 million as of 2023.</strong></p><p>He was reputedly earning £18 million a year at Arsenal before joining Fenerbahce.</p><p>Ozil was not just recognized for his income but also for being at the center of many historic occasions for this team, including the three FA Cup final victories.</p><p>Despite the fact that Ozil had his own reasons for leaving the team in early 2021, it was widely assumed that things had gone against him because he was not named in his manager Mikel Arteta’s Premier League or Europa League squads.</p><p>Furthermore, since March, Ozil was not selected for any of the 2020 games.</p><p>After joining Fenerbahce, Ozil takes a pay decrease of more than £300,000 per week.</p><p>Ozil will also be paid a signing bonus of €550,000 (£488,000) and will receive a total of €9 million (£8 million) over three years.</p><p>Interestingly, it was reported that Arsenal is still paying 90% of Mesut’s salary despite the fact that he has already transferred to his boyhood club, Fenerbahce.</p><p>You can imagine how hard he has worked for Arsenal and how well he has been known within the club.</p><h3>Mesut Ozil- Net Income</h3><p>The German player had recently signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal, which dramatically raised his salary and guaranteed his future with the English club until 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mesut-Ozil-300x300.jpeg><p>Apart from bonuses, Ozil earns a yearly salary of $24.4 million, which translates to $470,000 per week in basic weekly compensation.</p><p>He is presently the Premier League’s second-highest earner, with Manchester United’s Alexis Sanchez topping the list with a new weekly wage of $668,000.</p><h3>Contracts</h3><p>Mesut Ozil joined Arsenal for 42.5 million pounds in 2013.</p><p>In 2017, he agreed to a three-year contract deal with the organization, bringing his annual base salary from $12 million to $24 million.</p><p>That earns him a spot among the top ten highest-paid soccer players in the world.</p><p>Later, as an Arsenal player, he famously refused to take a wage cut, infuriating fans.</p><h2>Mesut Ozil: Net Worth in Different Currencies</h2><p>Let’s look at the Net Worth of Mesut Ozil in several currencies, including BitCoin, the cryptocurrency.</p><table

allow him to live a lavish life.</p><p>The German playmaker, who reportedly refused to take a pay reduction on his £350,000-per-week salaries because of a pandemic, now lives in a spectacular £10 million property in North London.</p><p>Mesut completed a variety of changes after purchasing the six-bedroom, three-story property.</p><p>To adorn his living room, he bought marble from Turkey, and he built a home cinema in which he could play hours of FIFA video game.</p><p>Mesut owns two esports teams, one of which competes in the EA Sports league and the other of which competes in Fortnite.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mesut-ozil-house.jpg><h3>Cars</h3><p>The world-class footballer is known for his personal style and love of automobiles.</p><p>Let’s look at Ozil’s collection of cars.</p><h3>Mercedes</h3><p>While Ozil’s Turkish ancestry is apparent, he is a fan of Mercedes Benz automobiles.</p><p>His favorite vehicle is a Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG, which costs roughly £143,305.</p><p>Then there’s his £183,000 S65 AMG, which is driven by a 6.0-liter V12 engine with 621 brake horsepower and is twin-turbocharged.</p><p>It’s a roomy coupe that can reach 62 mph in 4.1 seconds and is stylish, thanks to its elegant design.</p><h4>SLS AMG</h4><p>Ozil also has an SLS AMG two-door supercar (£165,030) that’s been in his collection since 2014.</p><p>It can go from 0 to 62 mph in 3.8 seconds and achieve a top speed of 196 mph.</p><p>It was originally dubbed “the greatest car in the world” by Jeremy Clarkson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mesut-ozil-SLS-AMG.jpg><p>Ozil has also been photographed driving a Ferrari 458 Italia worth over £200k, a £120k Porsche Panamera Turbo, and other Audis, including a Q7 (beginning at £52,075) and an RS5 (roughly £62,740) over the years.</p><h3>Private Jet</h3><p>According to sources, Mesut also possesses a private airplane.</p><p>Mesut Ozil was spotted napping on a private flight with his pet pug following Arsenal’s FA Cup victory in Islington on May 31, 2015.</p><p>He rushed to the airport after some sort of celebration and boarded his private jet with his favorite dog.</p><h2>Mesut Ozil: Lifestyle & Vacation</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Trust us when we say that the phrases “opulent” and “luxurious” don’t begin to depict his genuine, regal lifestyle.</p><p>After his £42.5 million departure from Real Madrid, the Arsenal playmaker repurchased his Hampstead mansion in 2016.</p><p>Mesut’s estate is decked out in Turkish marble, features a massive home theater and a trainer collection that includes multiple pairs of Adidas Yeezy Boots and Louboutins.</p><p>Mesut says his favorite room is this large space with the extended couch. This room is, of course, inspired by Turkish ancestors.</p><p>A painting of the Ottoman Sultan who captured Istanbul is also required in the living room.</p><h4>FIFA Room & Obsession for Trainer</h4><p>Mesut has also placed his brand’s emblem on the walkway leading to his home cinema and playroom (where he plays FIFA with his friends).</p><p>Apart from football, Ozil is also known for his vast trainer and accessory collection.</p><p>He owns eight pairs of Adidas Yeezy trainers, totaling almost $1700, from Kanye West’s highly sought-after collection.</p><p>Mesut also owns a pair of laceless Adidas ace 17+ Purecontrol boots, a symbol of the revolution he helped to bring about.</p><p>His boot collection also includes an £865 pair of gold-studded Louboutins.</p><p>And the headset he owns, which was created in collaboration with Balmain retail, is roughly $600.</p><h3>Vacation</h3><p>In March 2020, Mesut Ozil became the father of a daughter.</p><p>Mesut Ozil, a professional soccer player, is relishing his new role as a father. As Oil informed his admirers on Instagram, the “first trip with my little princess” is approaching.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mesut-ozil-vacation-e1637654975844-196x300.jpg><p>He also shared a photo of himself in a T-shirt, shorts, and sandals in front of a stroller with his daughter Eda, who is only a few months old.</p><h2>MesutOl Campaign, Book Publication, Media and Sponsorship</h2><h3>MesutOl Campaign</h3><p>Fenerbahce faced financial difficulties paying for Ozil.</p><p>That’s why they started a drive to ask their fans to contribute to Mesut’s wage by donating money to the club.</p><p>It was essentially an SMS campaign aimed at breaking the record for the most text messages received from his followers, maybe exceeding a million.</p><p>The SMS messages in this campaign will be forwarded to the number 1907, which is the year Fenerbahce was founded.</p><h3>Book Publication</h3><p>Mesut’s autobiography, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Magic of the Game/ Gunning for Greatness</a>, was published in 2017.</p><p>He has revealed the inner stories of his friendship with Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger in his book.</p><p>Mesut has also spoken about his efforts to assist the under-fire Frenchman in regaining Arsenal’s dominance.</p><p>He’s also detailed his lifestyle before earning a reputation for himself, as well as the prejudice he’s suffered as a result of being born to Turkish parents in German territory.</p><h3>Media and Sponsorship</h3><h4>Long run with Adidas</h4><p>Mesut accepted a reported £22 million offer from Adidas in 2013 to represent the Swoosh for the Three Stripes, which was not exactly a popular trend at the moment.</p><p>Mesut became the most important personality for the German brand in marketing campaigns that introduced the laceless revolution Adidas Purecontrol Ace 16 and later resurrected the Predator, seemingly out of nowhere.</p><p>When Mesut and Adidas split ways in 2020, he said that he planned to start his own brand, M10. It would also give him the freedom to dress as he pleases in the future.</p><p>Despite this, they had a long and prosperous 8-year adventure together.</p><p>Everyone who worked for Adidas knew that the contract would not be extended as Mesut built his own brand. Everything happened in accordance with the deal.</p><p>Mesut also got featured in one of the 2015 advertisements titled “Create Your Own Game.”</p><h4>M-10 brand</h4><p>According to soccerbible.com, Mesut Ozil revealed his goals after the 2014 World Cup when asked where he wanted to be in the next five years.</p><p>As a result, he realized that he needed to collaborate with top designers and people.</p><p>Then life happened; Mesut and his agent, Erkut Sogut, met James Bond, the owner of the sneaker business “Undefeated.”</p><p>Together they launched their M10 brand to the general public.</p><p>In addition, James frequently urged him to keep the product simple and straightforward, focusing on small quantities of caps and t-shirts while testing the mainstream market.</p><p>And, guess what? Everything was sold out within the first hour of the launch. Players like Sergio Ramos and Jerome Boateng wore M10 caps to promote the brand.</p><p>In reality, Mesut has declared that advertising his own brand will not meet his financial needs.</p><p>Instead, all earnings will be donated to charities because he is aware that he does not require money.
