Before committing to North Carolina, he was ranked by 247Sports as the No. 2 recruit in Carolina’s 2019 class.</p><p>He was considered the No. 87 overall prospect and the No. 3 quarterback in his graduating class. After the 2021 season, he will be considered one of the best quarterback prospects for the 2022 NFL Draft, so he may decide to sacrifice his remaining college eligibility. Know details about Sam Howell’s Parents below.</p><h2>Who Are Sam Howell Parents?</h2><p><strong>Sam Howell was born on September 16th, 2000 to Duke Howell and Amy Howell in Union County, where he grew up.</strong> Duke is also an accomplished American football trainer. As a proud father, he frequently attends his son’s NFL games to cheer him on.</p><p>Sam Howell comes from a unique family whose history dates back more than fifty years to South Korea. After the Korean War, Han, the daughter of Myong Sok Park and Kum Ok Yang, fell in love with Bruce Howell, an American soldier stationed in Korea. The family eventually made Monroe, North Carolina, their permanent home.</p><p>Han’s tragic loss of her husband left her to raise their two young children alone in a foreign land. Her undying love for her family set a standard that was followed by two generations of Howells.</p><p>Han was a dedicated businesswoman who also valued her faith and family life highly. She could often be found in the stands at football games, fervently cheering on her son, Duke, and grandson during Sam’s time at Sun Valley High School.</p><p>Amy, Howell’s mom, is just as proud of him and has always been there for him. Sam’s path to the NFL has not been without its challenges, but with his parents’ steadfast support, he has been able to overcome them with relative ease.</p><p><strong>You can also read about other celebrities’ parents’ details we have covered:</strong></p><h2>What Roles Have Duke and Amy Howell Played in Sam’s Journey to Success?</h2><p>Duke and Amy Howell, Sam’s parents, have always been there for him.
