Vince Gill began studying and playing multiple instruments at the encouragement of his mother and father. He played in various bluegrass groups throughout his high school years and after graduating began to perform more high profile gigs. In the late 70s, he began performing with Pure Prairie League, a group that he had once opened for while in high school. He sang lead on their hit song "Let Me Love You Tonight". In the 80s, he began to perform as a solo artist, and has gone on to record twenty successful studio albums. During his career, Vince Gill has sold more than 26 million albums worldwide.

He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2007.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Vince Gill was born on April 12, 1957 in Norman, Oklahoma. His father, J. Stanley Gill, worked as a lawyer and administrative law judge. He also played in a country music band part-time and encouraged Gill to begin playing music. As a child, Gill began learning how to play the guitar and banjo, and then later learned the bass, mandolin, Dobro, and fiddle. Gill grew up with his older half-brother, Bob Coen. He attended Northwest Classen High School in Oklahoma City. There, he played on the golf team and also performed in the bluegrass band Mountain Smoke, which had a strong local following. In 1975, after he finished high school, he moved to Louisville, Kentucky to join the band Bluegrass Alliance. He also was briefly a member of <a href=# title="Ricky Skaggs Net Worth">Ricky Skaggs</a>'s Boone Creek band before later moving to Los Angeles to join the bluegrass group Sundance, fronted by fiddler Byron Berline.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Vince Gill debuted on the national scene with the country rock band Pure Prairie League in 1979.

He left the label in 1989 to sign with MCA Records. His debut album on the label, "When I Call Your Name," sold over a million copies. Several of the tracks on the album made the U.S. Country top ten charts. He followed up the album with his second release, "Pocket Full of Gold," in 1991 and then "I Still Believe in You." The title track on the latter album reached the number one spot on the U.S. Country charts.</p><p>Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Gill continued releasing very successful albums. He became well-known for his virtuosic skills on the electric and acoustic guitars as well as his pure and soulful tenor voice. He also was a highly skilled songwriter. He became a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1991 and celebrated his 25th Opry anniversary with a tribute show in August of 2016.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-208082 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Vince-Gill.jpg alt="Vince Gill" width=594 height=443 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-208082 class=wp-caption-text>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</p><p>In addition to his solo career, Gill has continued collaborating with other artists.
